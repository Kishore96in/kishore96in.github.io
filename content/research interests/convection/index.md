![plumes in a simulation of convection](a6.0.1ls_r1_uz_plumes.png)

I am interested in the scales at which convection occurs in the Sun's convection zone.
Alas, progress is painfully slow.

I have worked on the following topics:
- plume/thermal modelling ([thesis](/blog/phd_thesis#chapter-8))
- magnetoconvection ([thesis](/blog/phd_thesis#chapter-10))
