My interest in turbulence itself is mostly driven by the desire to understand transport phenomena.

I have worked on the following topics:
- Rotating turbulence ([thesis](/blog/phd_thesis#chapter-2))
- Turbulent transport ([thesis](/blog/phd_thesis#chapter-4))
- Shell models {{< cite p kishoreShell2022 >}}
